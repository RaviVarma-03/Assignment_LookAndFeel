      <div class="text colorscheme">
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven
        players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)
        pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
        three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team,
        called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch
        towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once
        they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at
        each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch
        from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat.

      <div class="heading">History of Cricket</div>
      <div class="text">
        It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in
        the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval
        period. Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite
        reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court
        case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style), equating to January 1598
        in the modern calendar. The case concerned ownership of a certain plot
        of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John
        Derrick, who gave witness that: "Being a scholler in the ffree schoole
        of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at
        creckett and other plaies." Given Derrick's age, it was about half a
        century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket
        was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey.The view that it was
        originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611
        English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun "crosse" as "the
        crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket" and the verb form
        "crosser" as "to play at cricket".
